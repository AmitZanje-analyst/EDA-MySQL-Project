#  EDA Project - Exploratory Data Analysis

In this SQL EDA project, we embark on a journey to uncover hidden insights and patterns within our dataset using the power of Structured Query Language (SQL). Our objective is to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis, leveraging SQL queries to dig deep into the data and extract meaningful information.

Throughout this project, we will conduct various SQL operations to clean, filter, and aggregate the data, gaining a thorough understanding of its structure and characteristics. Our analysis will include descriptive statistics, data profiling, and the identification of key trends and outliers.

Join me on this SQL EDA adventure as we transform raw data into actionable knowledge, unlocking the potential for informed decision-making and strategic planning. Get ready to harness the full analytical power of SQL and illuminate the secrets concealed within our dataset!"
